In this project i have created one notebook for data loading, preprocessing, segmentation and everything.
The used datasets are emoji.csv and A_Z Handwritten Data.csv
For running this project, we should run main.py file.
In main.py file there is a Predict_Ans function which uses get_segmented function and predict the output.
We tested on img_tst.jpg at the end, and letters were predicted correct and one checkmark was also predicted correct, but sun and smile was wrongly predicted.
